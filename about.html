          This temple has a magnificent history of about 1200 years and is famous for its historical significance. It is
          one of the few temples in the entire country. In the forest area, ascetics had visions of the Supreme Brahman
          in the form of a sphere of light and worshipped in the formless form, leading to the construction of this
          temple in this region. Over time, the temple fell into disrepair. Later, the caretakers of the Bajala Budha
          Jain dynasty renovated this dilapidated temple and arranged for daily worship rituals, which is a legend. This
          temple serves as the village deity for seven surrounding villages: Maroli, Kankanadi, Bajala, Alape, Kinnur,
          Padavu, and Jappu.
          The Sri Suryanarayana Temple is surrounded by hills on three sides, with perennial sources of water flowing
          from these hills. Hence, the temple premises are cool and spacious with ample water resources. The entire area
          was rejuvenated by devotees during the renovation and consecration ceremonies of Sri Suryanarayana and the
          associated deities from April 17, 2016, to April 26, 2016. Daily worship rituals are conducted in the temple
          complex.
          The Sri Vaidyanatha deity in Karimbisthana is the main companion deity of this temple, and during the
          Brahmakalashotsava occasion, offerings are brought from here. The main shrine and the bathing hall of the Sri
          Kshetra are entirely made of stone and adorned with attractive red stone walls, wooden carvings, and
          Mangalore-tiled roofs. The various deities, including the nine planets, principal deities, sub-deities, the
          nine planets, stars, days, seasons, and epochs, are depicted in stone pillars and wooden carvings. Near the
          Sri Kshetra, there is a tank for the bathing of the deity.
          During times of illness, childlessness, and court cases, praying to Sri Suryanarayana is believed to yield
          results. Praying for rain through a special ceremony called Seeyalabhisheka is said to bring rain. Many
          devotees have experienced recovery from headaches, skin diseases, and stomach ailments after praying to the
          deity. The grace of Sri Suryanarayana is also believed to be beneficial for success in marriage and education.
          The temple is famous for its Seeyala Abhisheka ceremony. Various services such as Rangapuja, decoration puja,
          flower puja, Kartika puja, Rudrabhisheka, Suryanamaskara puja, and Suryasahasranama are conducted daily in the
          Sri Kshetra</section>

        The Sri Suryanarayana Temple stands as a testament to the enduring spiritual heritage of the region,
        encompassing a rich tapestry of tradition, devotion, and architectural marvels. Its origins steeped in mysticism
        and asceticism evoke a sense of reverence among the faithful who flock to its hallowed grounds seeking solace,
        healing, and blessings.

        Nestled amidst the tranquil embrace of nature, with hills guarding its perimeter and pristine waters gushing
        forth, the temple exudes an aura of sanctity and serenity. The divine presence is palpable as devotees traverse
        through the verdant pathways, leading to the sacred precincts where ancient rituals are performed with
        unwavering devotion.

        The restoration efforts spearheaded by the caretakers of the illustrious Bajala Budha Jain dynasty have breathed
        new life into the temple, reinstating it as a beacon of faith and cultural heritage. Through meticulous
        craftsmanship and dedication, the dilapidated structures have been resurrected, allowing worshippers to once
        again pay homage to the celestial deities enshrined within.

        At the heart of the temple complex lies the resplendent Sri Suryanarayana deity, revered for its benevolent
        grace and transformative powers. It is a revered tradition among devotees to offer prayers and conduct rituals
        to invoke blessings for various aspects of life, including health, prosperity, and harmony.

        The symbiotic relationship between the Sri Suryanarayana Temple and the adjacent Sri Vaidyanatha deity in
        Karimbisthana symbolizes the interconnectedness of divine forces, wherein offerings exchanged during sacred
        ceremonies strengthen the spiritual bond between the two sanctuaries.

        The architectural grandeur of the temple, characterized by intricate stone carvings, vibrant wooden
        embellishments, and majestic Mangalore-tiled roofs, serves as a testament to the skilled craftsmanship of bygone
        eras. Each facet of the temple's design reflects a harmonious blend of artistic expression and religious
        symbolism, encapsulating the essence of divine beauty.

        Devotees flock to the temple not only in times of distress but also in moments of celebration and gratitude,
        recognizing the omnipresent benevolence of Sri Suryanarayana. From seeking relief from ailments to invoking
        blessings for auspicious occasions such as weddings and academic pursuits, the temple serves as a sanctum of
        solace and hope for all who enter its sacred confines.

        As the sacred chants reverberate through the temple halls and the fragrance of incense fills the air,
        worshippers are transported into a realm of transcendental bliss, where earthly worries dissolve in the divine
        embrace of Sri Suryanarayana. With each prayer offered and each ritual performed, the timeless legacy of the
        temple continues to resonate, bridging the gap between the mortal and the divine. </section>
